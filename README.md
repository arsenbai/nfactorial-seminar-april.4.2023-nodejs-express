# nFactorial School Seminar on April-4, 2023

## Topic: NodeJS/Eexpress
## Lecturer: [Samat Kalshabekov] (https://github.com/Fatdrfrog)

I practice usage of:
- middlewares, 
- sending information in JSON to the server via POST request,
- adding custom Headers to request,
- reading custom Headers.

I used Insomnia REST Client of MIT in order to test correctness of my code.


## Installation
To install dependencies I used in package-lock.json file:
1. Make sure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory where you forked current repository.
3. Run the following command to install the dependencies specified in the package-lock.json file:
```
npm ci
```
